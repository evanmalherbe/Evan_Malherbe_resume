            <p>
                I'm a friendly, easy going person that loves to meet new people. I enjoy a challenge and find the world
                completely fascinating.
                I'm passionate about fitness and working out. At various times in the last few years, I've done running,
                on road cycling, mountain
                biking and I'm currently enjoying powerlifting. It seems to take ages to make real progress in terms of
                fitness or increased muscle mass, but the journey is fun and challenging. I'm motivated by the prospect
                of a fulfilling career doing something that I enjoy. I'm presently loving the journey of learning Web
                Development and am optimistic about my future in this space.

                I matriculated from Westville Boys' High School in 2001, then completed my Bachelor of Arts in
                Humanities
                degree at Stellenbosch University in 2007. I later went on to get my Post Graduate Certificate in
                Education
                (PGCE) through UNISA in 2011. I am currently (Nov 2021) completing a 3 month Full Stack Web Development
                Bootcamp
                through <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/" target="_blank">HyperionDev</a>.

            <p>
                After school I worked at "Market Wizards" doing sales and technical support for 2 years. They were a
                company
                that trained people to successfully trade the South African stock market. I moved on to Impro
                Technologies,
                where I was one of their Business Development Managers. They specialised in Access Control and security
                systems. After Impro, I decided to study Education and worked at Winston Park Primary School for the
                year as
                an Intern, while I studied my Post Graduate Certificate in Education through Unisa.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following year, once I had graduated, I worked at Lyndhurst Primary School as a grade 4 and 5
                teacher. I
                worked at Lyndhurst for 3 years before starting work as a staff trainer and copywriter at iX Online
                Motoring
                (they do websites and Social Media for the motor industry). I stayed for 3 years before moving to work
                as an
                Intern Estate Agent at Pam Golding Properties Westville. I worked as an agent for 2 years and am now
                studying web Development through HyperionDev.

            <h3>Music Track Storage Website</h3>
            <p>
                This little project is one of my first demontrations of working with the Web storage API and JSON to
                store
                user input and transfer it from one webpage to another. It asks the user to enter some information about
                their favourite music tracks and then displays the information on the page. The user can then edit or
                delete
                track information as well.

            <p>
                I've most recently worked on a project for my coding bootcamp that involved creating a functioning
                online
                store, complete with (pretend) products and a shopping cart. It has been very challenging but so
                rewarding.
                This website is built using all of the languages that I have been learning to use, including HTML, CSS,
                Javascript and jQuery.
